# blog-api

Blog API is an API used to facilitate data between the Back-End as a proxy for the Database to the user on the Front-End. This application is to be used in conjunction with a Front-End. The API follows the practice of REST and is a RESTful API that will only receive and send JSON data. In addition, a full array of CRUD operations are permitted to be used within the API to modify data on the database through token/account authentication and account rights.
